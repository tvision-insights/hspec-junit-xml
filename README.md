# hspec-junit-xml

Formatter for Hspec that creates test reports in the "JUnit" format that's understood by CI tools,
including the elasped time of each test. The elapsed time is also added to the Hspec's `specdoc`
formatter's output for human consumption.

The time formatter can also be used separately.
